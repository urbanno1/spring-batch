Endpoints in the application:

1. "http://localhost:8080/adduser" - to add a user to the application.
2. "http://localhost:8080/authenticate" - to authenticate a user and generate a token for a user.
3. "http://localhost:8080/load" to automate the batch process

Procedures:

**** first do docker-compose to run the dockerized application ****

I: First get authenticated into the system by using the following admin user at
url:  "http://localhost:8080/authenticate"
method: POST
ContentType: application/json.

Copy this json to the 'raw' body of postman for authentication:

{
	"username": "Chinedu",
	"password": "chinedu"
}


II. Pass the header as "Authorization" then  Bearer + " token generated" (add a space between the Bearer and token generated)
  to be able to call the load api to kickstart the batch process. at url "http://localhost:8080/load"
